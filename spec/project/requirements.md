# GenOffice Project — Requirements

## R-001 Canonical project model

The product SHALL maintain one canonical `ProjectDocument` independent of host/runtime and shall give every entity stable identity.

## R-002 Task semantics

Tasks SHALL represent hierarchy, scheduling mode, dates, duration, constraints, deadlines, priority, calendar, progress, work/cost fields, baselines, custom fields, parent identity, notes, and derived scheduling fields.

## R-003 Dependencies

The engine SHALL support FS, SS, FF, and SF relationships with positive/negative lag and SHALL reject cycles, self dependencies, missing task references, and missing calendar references.

## R-004 Calendar determinism

The engine SHALL support weekly working periods, working hours, holidays/exceptions, inherited calendars, task calendars, and deterministic working-time arithmetic.

## R-005 Scheduling determinism

Given identical canonical inputs, scheduling SHALL return identical task dates, dependency effects, early/late dates, criticality, and float on every run.

## R-006 Semantic commands

User intent SHALL be represented by semantic `ProjectCommand` values. The history model SHALL be capable of deterministic undo/redo without encoding Project semantics in the renderer.

## R-007 Resource-ready model

The canonical model SHALL contain resources and assignments even though resource calculations are deferred beyond PROJECT-006.

## R-008 File interoperability boundary

The architecture SHALL separate canonical state from `.gproj`, MSPDI, and MPP adapters. Unsupported imported features SHALL eventually produce explicit diagnostics rather than silent loss.

## R-009 Shared renderer boundary

Desktop and web SHALL use the same Project renderer contracts and semantic engine. Host-specific APIs SHALL remain outside the renderer.

## R-010 Verification authority

Each feature SHALL have objective acceptance evidence. UI appearance alone SHALL never establish completion. Save/reopen and canonical-engine re-evaluation are required for persisted features once file support exists.

## Foundation acceptance — PROJECT-001..006

A fixture containing tasks, calendars, dependencies, and deterministic scheduling inputs SHALL be validated and scheduled repeatedly with identical results. The result SHALL expose task start/finish, early/late dates, total/free float, and criticality, and the dependency engine SHALL reject invalid graphs.

## PROJECT-007 canonical semantic clarifications

These clarifications record the canonical decisions required to implement task/WBS/summary semantics (PROJECT-007). They refine R-001, R-002, and R-006 without altering any frozen invariant; no architecture-change proposal is required.

- **Sibling ordering representation**: the relative order of tasks inside `ProjectDocument.tasks` is the canonical sibling ordering. Array position expresses ordering only and is never identity (identity is `TaskId`) and never hierarchy (hierarchy is `parentTaskId`). This is the smallest architecture-compatible representation: no ordering field is added to the frozen Task model, and because ordering is positional an invalid sibling ordering cannot be represented.
- **WBS derivation**: WBS codes are derived deterministically by depth-first traversal of the canonical hierarchy, numbering siblings from 1 at each level (for example `1`, `1.1`, `1.2`, `2`, `2.1`) to arbitrary depth. WBS is a derived hierarchy representation and never identity.
- **Outline level derivation**: `outlineLevel` equals hierarchy depth (root = 1, child = parent + 1) and is recomputed on every accepted hierarchy mutation. Documents with outline levels inconsistent with depth are invalid.
- **Summary semantics**: the `summary` flag is a derived semantic value — a task is a summary iff it has at least one child. Summary dates and duration are computed by the scheduling engine roll-up and are never authoritative in renderer state or in document-level duration fields.
- **Task UID uniqueness**: task `uid` values are unique within a document because they are persistent interoperability identifiers; local `TaskId` remains the canonical application identity.
- **CreateTask**: inserts the task as the last child of `parentTaskId`, or as the last root task when no parent is given. Derived fields (`outlineLevel`, `wbs`, `summary`) are recomputed by the engine; a created task is always a leaf.
- **DeleteTask**: deleting a task deletes its entire descendant subtree (the Microsoft Project outline-deletion behavior) and removes dependencies, assignments, and baseline snapshots that reference deleted tasks, so every accepted mutation leaves the document valid.
- **IndentTask**: accepted only when `parentTaskId` is the task's immediately preceding sibling; the task becomes that sibling's last child. Indenting beneath a descendant, a missing target, the first task with no preceding sibling, or any other target is rejected with a diagnostic.
- **OutdentTask**: the task (with its own subtree) becomes the next sibling of its former parent. Outdenting a root task is rejected. A former parent with no remaining children reverts to a leaf.
- **Command application**: `applyProjectCommand` is a pure deterministic function. Rejected commands return the input document unchanged with diagnostics; accepted commands leave the document in canonical outline order with recomputed derived hierarchy fields. The PROJECT-006 invariant that dependencies between a summary task and its own descendants are invalid is preserved across hierarchy mutations.
